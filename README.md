# 🤝 Hey, I’m Patryk!

**A Computer Science student on a quest to master Application Development in Krakow.**


 💻 **I love building apps, solving (or creating) bugs, and experimenting with new technologies.**
 
🐍 **Python? Love it. ☕ Java? Tolerable. Debugging? My daily emotional rollercoaster.**

 ⚡ **Fun fact: 90% of my coding time is just googling errors.**
