👋 Hey, I’m Patryk!
A Computer Science student on a quest to master Application Development. 

💻 I love building apps, solving (or creating) bugs, and experimenting with new technologies.
🐍 Python? Love it. ☕ Java? Tolerable. Debugging? My daily emotional rollercoaster.
⚡ Fun fact: 90% of my coding time is just googling errors.
